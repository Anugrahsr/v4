# Biologist to CyberSecurity Analyst: My InfoSec Journey

Hi everyone, my name is Anugrah SR, I am a Cyber security analyst and this is my story. <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

I get a lot of DMs asking, how I got into cybersecurity after graduating masters in biology? I wonder the same, how I transitioned from a scientific research background to cybersecurity. When I look back, I see a long path which I once believed was impossible. I don't know if it's fate, stars aligned, everything happened. As of today, I mark the 100th day of my first job in cybersecurity. Let me try to explain my journey. <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

## The Academic Foundation

I opted to pursue my master's in life science because it was interesting to learn and there was a lot to explore. I tried my hands on lab work, cell culturing and experimentation, but computational biology caught my attention. I was more interested in learning how a simple combination of an ATGC codon and environment make a blueprint for what we are. <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

## The Learning Phase

The transition into cybersecurity required learning everything from scratch. I started with the fundamentals and gradually built my knowledge through various platforms and communities.

### Community and Continuous Learning

Infosec twitter is a great place where apart from the occasional drama, you will learn a lot, and can directly talk to experts in the field but the best part is the GIVEAWAYS! <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

### The Reality of Bug Hunting

One of the most important lessons I learned early on was about patience and persistence:

> "You won't find a bug in 5min or 1hr of testing as you see in these tweet. You just started your journey, it will take hour's, days, weeks or months to find your bug. The people who find fast are the people who knows where to look for them with their experience. Enjoy the process!" <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

### Daily Practice and Improvement

I documented my learning journey with daily updates:

> "#day1 #100daystolearnandimprove -> done some bash -> read some write-up -> tried to hack on public program found some critical files. Gona report tomorrow" <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Professional Breakthrough

### The Internship Opportunity

After months of learning and practicing, I got an unexpected opportunity. I received a message asking if I was interested in a full-time job. After going through the interview and technical rounds, I got my offer letter! My first job as Cyber security analyst. <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

### Working in the Field

Working with most talented people in the field, updating and upgrading my skill sets and protecting the organization from potential threats, its pretty cool if you ask me. <mcreference link="https://www.p1boom.com/2021/08/my-Infosec-journey.html" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Speaking and Sharing Knowledge

In 2022, I had the opportunity to be a speaker at IWCON 2022 - Online Infosec Conference & Networking Event. It was a great honor to be invited to speak at such a respected conference, and I was thrilled to share my experiences with the audience. I delivered a talk on the topic "Journey from being a Biologist to a Security Consultant." <mcreference link="https://anugrahsr.in/my-infosec-2022/" index="2">2</mcreference>

## Reflections and Lessons

When I start having all the impostor syndrome and doubt of my existence, talks about "Hacking your career in cybersecurity" made me realize how I got here and how much dedication and hard work I had put in to be in Infosec holding a degree in biology. <mcreference link="https://anugrahsr.in/my-infosec-2022/" index="2">2</mcreference>

## Key Takeaways

1. **Patience is Essential**: Finding vulnerabilities takes time - hours, days, weeks, or even months. Don't expect immediate results.

2. **Community Support**: The InfoSec community, especially on Twitter, provides incredible learning opportunities and support.

3. **Continuous Learning**: Cybersecurity requires constant skill updates and learning new techniques.

4. **Enjoy the Process**: Rather than rushing for quick wins, embrace the learning journey.

5. **Background Diversity**: A non-traditional background like biology can actually be an asset in cybersecurity.

## Looking Forward

Overall, I'm proud of the progress I made, and I'm looking forward to continuing to grow and learn in the future. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey so far. I am proud to be a part of the community, a group of individuals who are solely focused on helping and educating people in cybersecurity. <mcreference link="https://anugrahsr.in/my-infosec-2022/" index="2">2</mcreference>
